Methaprograming is for lazy coders, as a great coders the goal is to produce the best functionality with less typing, so if you have the same opinion methaprograming is dedicated to achieve that.

Yoman framework is a generator of generators, is been gaining a lot of traction latelly, on this PoC I am trying to came to a simple process of creating a generator using yoman to facilitate how we easily change sequence and questions asked by the geenrator.

One of the things about questionaire base generators is that make it easier to start but while you are get confortable, trying to reproduce over and over again your generation process it time consuming. It would be easier if you have a mechanism to remember your responses or run the entire process in "silent mode".

## The design

We will cerate a main entry point or app generator and a subgenerator just to say hi <name>>.
